Format:
    > Every animation has it's own file.
    
    > Every animation accessible by name through an enum.
    
    > Only two text files need to be changed
      to add a new animation.
      
    > Animation length can be changed without
      updating any text files.


Details:

Every animation name is listed in "textures/animation_names.txt"
so that they can be loaded in that order.

That same list of names is pasted into the animation_ids enum in graphics.h
so that each animation can be referred to by name in the program.

The length of each animation is calculated upon load time,
then stored in the anim_len array.
